                    <p class="project-description">In collaboration with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, IL,
                        the Helping Hand was created as an assistive gripping device for users with limited hand 
                        function due to spinal cord injuries. As part of a team of four Northwestern engineering students,
                        I created a high-fidelity prototype for one specific user, which enabled him to walk with crutches,
                         operate a vehicle, and eat independently.

                    <p class="project-description">I am currently working as part of the dev team for a new mobile 
                        app called Caravan. The purpose of the app is to connect skiers/snowboarders in Denver with 
                        rides up the mountain. We are working in collaboration with a client in Denver.

                    <p class="project-description">In collaboration with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, IL,
                        the SipLine was created as a call method for patients who are unable to move their limbs. Rather than pressing
                        a button as most patients do to alert a nurse that they are in need of attention, users of the 
                        SipLine blow into a tube attached to their bed and positioned near the mouth. The change in air pressure sets off
                        a notification at the nurses' station.
